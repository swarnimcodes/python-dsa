# Solving DSA Problems in Python

Welcome to my DSA problem-solving repository. Here I try and tackle Data Structures and
Algorithm challenges using Python üêç. This repository is me documenting my journey to get better at
problem solving and learning about DSA concepts.

## About this Repository
- While I adore strong static typed languages, functional languages even more so; I also
think while learning DSA concepts, the focus should be on the problem at hand. Python, for me,
gets out of the way.
- Every solution here is battle-tested with a set of rigorous test cases. Ensuring accuracy is non-negotiable for me, and these test cases are my guarantee that my code works as expected.
- Returning to the topic of types, I wholeheartedly recognize their importance. To enhance code clarity and minimize potential errors and headaches, I meticulously include type hints for all relevant variables. These hints not only make the code more readable but also act as a safeguard against unexpected issues.
