# Solving DSA Problems in Python

Welcome to my DSA problem-solving repository. Here I try and tackle Data Structures and
algorithm challenges using Python üêç. This repository is me documenting my journey to get better at
problem solving and learning about DSA concepts.

## About this Repository
- While I adore strong static typed languages, functional languages even more so; I also
think while learning DSA concepts, the focus should be on the problem at hand. Python, for me,
gets out of the way.
- Every solution here is battle-tested with a set of rigorous test cases. Ensuring accuracy is non-negotiable for me, and these test cases are my guarantee that my code works as expected.
- Coming back to types, I understand their value. To this end, I make sure to provide type hints for all variables wherever applicable. This not only aids in code readability but also minimizes potential errors and headaches.
